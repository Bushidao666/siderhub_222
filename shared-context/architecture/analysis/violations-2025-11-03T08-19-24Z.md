# Architectural Violations — SiderHub

Status: Few critical integration gaps. Timestamp: ${TS}

## Violations
- API Aggregator mismatch: Frontend expects `/hub/*` + academy featured/recommended + hidra overview endpoints that do not exist in backend.
  - Files: `src/frontend/hooks/useHubData.ts` vs `src/backend/api/**`.
- Service Layer not wired: `src/backend/server.ts` declares `as any` stubs for non-auth services — backend cannot serve implemented endpoints at runtime.
- Type assertions in Prisma repositories (acceptable temporarily) should be replaced with typed mappers per architecture guidelines.

## Non-violations (Good)
- Frontend does not import from `src/backend/**` directly.
- Shared types consumed via `@shared/*` path alias.
