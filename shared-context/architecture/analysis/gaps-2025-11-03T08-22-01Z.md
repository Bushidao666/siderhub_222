# Gaps — Missing Features vs PRD

Timestamp: 2025-11-03T08:22:01Z

- Hub banners public/member API missing (frontend expects `/hub/banners`)
- Academy featured and recommended endpoints missing
- Drip content policies: by days and "after completion" not implemented (only `releaseAt`/preview)
- Video.js player integration (plugins, hotkeys, quality) not present; no 10s progress ticks to backend
- Lesson rating system (per lesson) absent (UI + API + DB)
- Cybervault UI not calling download tracking endpoint
- Backend services not DI-wired in server (stubs)
