# PRD Coverage — SiderHub

Status: Initial pass (evidence-based). Timestamp: ${TS}

## Summary
- Identity/Auth (SSO): Implemented (auth routes + store)
- Hub Home: Partial (frontend expects aggregator endpoints not present in backend)
- Academy: Partial (courses, tree, progress, comments exist; ratings + advanced drip + video tracking missing)
- Hidra: Partial (config, create/schedule campaign, metrics, dashboard exist)
- Cybervault: Implemented (list/detail, download tracking)
- Admin: Implemented (banners, feature toggles, access overrides, invitations)

## Evidence
- Front aggregator endpoints missing:
  - src/frontend/hooks/useHubData.ts:31 calls `/hub/banners?status=active` — no backend `src/backend/api/hub` routes found.
  - src/frontend/hooks/useHubData.ts:32 calls `/academy/courses/featured` — not present in `src/backend/api/academy/index.ts`.
  - src/frontend/hooks/useHubData.ts:33 calls `/academy/courses/recommended` — not present in `src/backend/api/academy/index.ts`.
  - src/frontend/hooks/useHubData.ts:34 calls `/hidra/campaigns/metrics/overview` — not present in `src/backend/api/hidra/index.ts`.
- Academy endpoints present: `GET /academy/courses`, `GET /academy/courses/:id/tree`, `POST /academy/progress`, `POST /academy/lessons/:id/comments` in `src/backend/api/academy/index.ts`.
- AcademyService gating uses simple `releaseAt` and preview logic only — no “after completion” or “x days drip” logic in `src/backend/services/academy/AcademyService.ts`.
- Lesson ratings feature not found in backend or frontend.
- Video.js requirement not met; frontend uses native `<video>` in `src/frontend/components/academy/LessonPlayer.tsx`.
- Cybervault aligns with PRD: `GET /cybervault/resources`, `GET /cybervault/resources/:slug`, `POST /cybervault/resources/:id/download` in `src/backend/api/cybervault/index.ts`.
- Admin aligns with PRD: banners, toggles, overrides, invitations in `src/backend/api/admin/index.ts`.
